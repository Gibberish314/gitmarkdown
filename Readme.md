# Practicing with Git and Markdown
#### AKA: This is bullshit but I'm gonna do it.

### **Shut up though.**
By doing this  the hope is that someday I will become smart and pull down 70k a year to essentially twiddle my fucking thumbs and drink kombucha all day. Then drive home in my sky blue fucking prius and literally roll around in money until I fall asleep.

#### Purpose:
1. Pass this class.
2. ???
3. roll in money til I fall asleep.
4. Probably hot cocoa in there too somewhere. Like right before bed.
5. How sweet would that be right?

#### Directions:
1. Pick up your little teeth
2. Put them in your shirt pocket.
3. Smile and say thank you.

#### Into these lessons I have poured:
* All of my malice.
* All of my hate.
* All of my will to dominate the free people of middle earth.

And if you dont like it I got two words for ya...
